I am very interested in Biology, Medicine, and more particularly in Neurosciences. I would love to help in the better understanding of these fields and to do that, I started coding. I tried before different approaches to work in these fields, like rat experimentations but I really prefer coding. Then, I found out that informatics and artificial intelligence can also be powerful tools in order to better understand Life Sciences.

As a Machine Learning Engineer, I implemented state of the art machine learning models (in python using pandas, numpy and scikit learn libraries) in order to predict the brain age and cognitive scores from anatomical brain mri as part of the thesis project of Iris Menu.

As a Data Engineer, I participated to design and construct data preprocessings and quality checks containers [brainprep](https://github.com/neurospin-deepinsight/brainprep). I also participated in the implementation of cloud services to collect, process and share different types of clinical data (based on the Nextcloud technology) [Neurospin Cloud](https://neurospin-cloud.cea.fr). 

As an assistant of the project manager, Iâ€™m currently working with a multicultural European team which involves to construct the specifications of the data sent by the providers and to exchange on some project-related problematics. I also wrote documentations for the [Neurospin Cloud](https://neurospin-cloud.cea.fr) and standards operating procedures for multi modal data (neuroimaging, omics, actigraphy, smartphone, eCRF).
